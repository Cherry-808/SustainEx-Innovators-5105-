Automated ESG Data Extraction and Performance Analysis
Project Context:
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting has become increasingly crucial for businesses and investors. However, the process of extracting relevant ESG information from unstructured reports is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, evaluating ESG performance across companies and industries remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, easily comparable data.
This project aims to develop an innovative system that automates the extraction of ESG information from unstructured reports and provides a comprehensive analysis of ESG performance within selected industries. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and data analysis, the project seeks to streamline the ESG data extraction process, improve data quality, and offer valuable insights into corporate sustainability practices.
