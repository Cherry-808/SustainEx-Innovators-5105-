        <p>

        <p>
            ESG-related regulations are evolving with a focus on strengthening compliance requirements across environmental, social,

            reduction and sustainable production. Social regulations increasingly emphasize supply chain transparency and labor rights,

            challenges and competitive opportunities, and [Company Name] remains vigilant in tracking both global and domestic policy changes 
            to enhance its ESG strategy and meet the heightened expectations of industry and society.
