        <h2>1. Background</h2>
        <h3>1) Overview of ESG Policies and Regulations</h3>
        <p>
            The global focus on sustainable development has led to the introduction of numerous ESG-related regulations 
            by international bodies and national governments. Key policies such as the Paris Agreement, the EU's Sustainable 
            Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and domestic initiatives like carbon neutrality targets compel companies 
            to enhance environmental protection, social responsibility, and governance transparency. Our Company is committed 
            to complying with these regulations through comprehensive ESG management, thus aligning with global sustainability goals.
        </p>
        <h3>2) ESG Model Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This report evaluates [Company Name]'s performance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) areas 
            using a proprietary scoring system that considers industry standards and regulatory benchmarks.
        </p>
        <h3>3) Trends in ESG Regulations and Corporate Strategies</h3>
        <p>
            ESG regulatory standards are becoming stricter, requiring companies to disclose emissions, manage resources efficiently, 
            and improve supply chain transparency. Companies must adapt to these rising standards by optimizing ESG strategies to meet 
            compliance and enhance their competitive edge.
        </p>
        <h3>4) ESG Performance Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>
            To create a reliable ESG assessment, [Company Name] has established standardized benchmarks based on industry practices 
            and best practices. This structured approach addresses data consistency, enabling fair comparisons across companies and 
            promoting sustainable growth and transparency.
