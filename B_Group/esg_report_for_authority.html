        <h3>2) Model Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Our model assesses Sample Company’s ESG compliance and performance across key dimensions, including Environmental 
            Impact, Social Responsibility, and Governance Structures. Each dimension is evaluated using industry-aligned indicators, 
            offering a comprehensive view of compliance and sustainability efforts.

        <h3>3) Trends in Regulatory Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            ESG-related regulations are evolving with a focus on strengthening compliance requirements across environmental, social, 
            and governance aspects. Climate action policies in the environmental sector encourage companies to invest in emissions 
            reduction and sustainable production. Social regulations increasingly emphasize supply chain transparency and labor rights, 
            while governance regulations promote anti-corruption measures and data protection. These regulatory shifts present compliance 
            challenges and competitive opportunities, and Sample Company remains vigilant in tracking both global and domestic policy changes 
            to enhance its ESG strategy and meet the heightened expectations of industry and society.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4) Standardized ESG Performance Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>
            To enhance transparency and ensure fair comparisons within the industry, Sample Company has established standardized ESG 
            benchmarks. These benchmarks, created using advanced data processing techniques to address data inconsistencies, 
            enable consistent comparisons and guide strategic improvements. This approach strengthens Sample Company's competitiveness in 
            the ESG arena and supports sustainable decision-making.
